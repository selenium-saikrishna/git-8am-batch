Resource
A resource is a statement of configuration policy
It describes the desired state of an element and it also specifies the steps needed to bring the item to the desired state

Resources are created using a scripting language called ruby

Eg File resource:This is used for creating and managing files

Create a chef resource for using file and create a file with some data on the local machine

mkdir resources
cd resources
vim sample1.rb
file /home/centos/resources/hello.txt  do
   content "Hello IntelliQ \n"
end

Save and quit
To run the above resource
sudo chef-client --local-mode sample1.rb

Policy:These are similar to arguments of ansible which are passed using -a option
Policies are defined in a resource and in the previous playbook we gave one policy ie content

Based on these plocies chef will bring the remote machine to the desired state

To create a resource for creating files and sending content and also controlling the ownership,groupowner ship and permissions

vim sample2.rb
file '/home/centos/resources/hello.txt'  do
   content "Hello IntelliQ \n"
   mode '777'
   owner 'root'
   group 'root'
end

Run the above resource 
sudo chef-client --local-mode sample2.rb

Similarly to install packages we have a resource called package

Create a chef resource for installing httpd and tree
vim sample3.rb
package 'tree' do
   action :install
end
package 'httpd' do
   action :install
end
Save and quit
Run the above resource 
sudo chef-client --local-mode sample3.rb
